  abstract  = {The wide use of GPS sensors in smart phones encourages
people to record their personal trajectories and share them with others
in the Internet. A recommendation service is needed to help people pro-
cess the large quantity of trajectories and select potentially interesting
ones. The GPS trace data is a new format of information and few works
focus on building user preference profiles on it. In this work we proposed
a trajectory recommendation framework and developed three recommen-
dation methods, namely, Activity-Based Recommendation (ABR), GPS-
Based Recommendation (GBR) and Hybrid Recommendation. The ABR
recommends trajectories purely relying on activity tags. For GBR, we
proposed a generative model to construct user profiles based on GPS
traces. The Hybrid recommendation combines the ABR and GBR. We
finally conducted extensive experiments to evaluate these proposed solu-
tions and it turned out the hybrid solution displays the best performance.},

of urban communities in a daily cycle of a city using scalable methods
of social network analysis. Using mobile phone network records, we have
observed spatial patterns in community structures at fine spatial scales
which are most likely related to the activities typical to the different
functional regions of a city. It is known that interactions between different
parts of the city are subject to a distance decay, moreover, our findings
show that regardless of the time of the day or current activity, people tend
to communicate within a spatially enclosed community. Furthermore, we
have investigated transitions and transformations of these communities
at the temporal scales of several hours related to the cycles of human
movement and activities in a city.},

Yet, a majority of Home Detection Algorithms (HDAs) suffer from {\textquotedblleft}blind{\textquotedblright} deployment of criteria to define homes and from limited possibilities for validation. In this paper, we investigate the performance and capabilities of five popular criteria for home detection based on a very large mobile phone dataset from France (~18 million users, 6 months). Furthermore, we construct a data-driven framework to assess the spatial uncertainty related to the application of HDAs. Our findings appropriate patial uncertainty in HDA and, in extension, for detection of meaningful places. We show how spatial uncertainties on the individuals{\textquoteright} level can be assessed in absence of ground truth annotation, how they relate to traditional, igh-level validation practices and how they can be used to improve results for, e.g., nation-wide population estimation.},

challenges of building informative, yet unobtrusive sensors. The most widely 
deployed and used mobile computing device today is the mobile phone, which 
presents an obvious candidate for recognizing activities. This paper explores 
how coarse-grained GSM data from mobile phones can be used to recognize 
high-level properties of user mobility, and daily step count. We demonstrate 
that even without knowledge of observed cell tower locations, we can recognize 
mobility modes that are useful for several application domains. Our mobility 
detection system was evaluated with GSM traces from the everyday lives of 
three data collectors over a period of one month, yielding an overall average ac-
curacy of 85%, and a daily step count number that reasonably approximates the 
numbers determined by several commercial pedometers.},

  abstract  = {Web surveys are a popular survey mode, but the subpopulation with Internet access may not represent the population of interest. The authors investigate whether adjusting using weights or matching on a small set of variables makes the distributions of target variables representative of the population. This application has a rich sampling design; the Internet sample is part of an existing probability sample, the Health and Retirement Study, that is representative of the U.S. population aged 50 and older. For the dichotomous variables investigated, the adjustment helps. On average, the sample means in the Internet access sample differ by 6.5 percent before and 3.7 percent after adjustment. Still, a large number of adjusted estimates remain significantly different from their target estimates based on the complete sample. This casts doubt on the common procedure to use only a few variables to correct for the selectivity of convenience samples.},

planning studies, and there has been a continuous effort to employ new approaches in order 
to increase the accuracy of collected data and reflect the real behaviour of individuals. Many 
approaches have been utilized for performing travel surveys, but there are still significant 
areas for improvement, as they need considerable financial and human resources, have an 
insufficient time-coverage and mostly engage respondents considerably, which sometimes 
implies biased results.},

Introduction In our modern world more and more data are generated on the web and produced by sensors in the ever growing number of electronic devices surrounding us. The amount of data and the frequency at which they are produced have led to the introduction of the term {\textquoteleft}Big Data{\textquoteright} (Lynch 2008). These are data sources that can be --generally-- described as: {\textquotedblleft}high volume, velocity and variety of data that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of processing for enhanced insight and decision making{\textquotedblright}. This is a variant of the definition proposed by Gartner (2012). More on Big Data and their innovative potential can be found in the McKinsey report (Manyika et al. 2011). In addition to generating new commercial opportunities in the private sector, Big Data are potentially a very interesting data source for official statistics; either for use on their own, or in combination with more traditional data sources such as sample surveys and}

  abstract  = {Gathering and analyzing location data is an important part
of many ubiquitous computing applications. The most common way to
represent location information is to use numerical coordinates, e.g., lat-
itudes and longitudes. A problem with this approach is that numerical
coordinates are usually meaningless to a user and they contrast with the
way humans refer to locations in daily communication. Instead of using
coordinates, humans tend to use descriptive statements about their lo-
cation; for example, {\textquotedblright}I{\textquoteright}m home{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblright}I{\textquoteright}m at Starbucks.{\textquotedblright} Locations, to
which a user can attach meaningful and descriptive semantics, are of-
ten called places. In this paper we focus on the automatic extraction of
places from discontinuous GPS measurements. We describe and evaluate
a non-parametric Bayesian approach for identifying places from this kind
of data. The main novelty of our approach is that the algorithm is fully
automated and does not require any parameter tuning. Another novel
aspect of our algorithm is that it can accurately identify places without
temporal information. We evaluate our approach using data that has
been gathered from different users and different geographic areas. The
traces that we use exhibit different characteristics and contain data from
daily life as well as from traveling abroad. We also compare our algo-
rithm against the popular k-means algorithm. The results indicate that
our method can accurately identify meaningful places from a variety of
location traces and that the algorithm is robust against noise.},

  Abstract                 = {The movement of people within cities forms patterns and changes the development of transport systems as well as innovations within the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. The City of Johannesburg has been witnessing massive transformations in urban public transport systems in the past decade and very little is currently known about the movement patterns of commuters between major centres of the city. Investigating and illuminating novel insights on the movement patterns of commuters is very imperative and essential given the multiplicity of modes and centres in increasing decentralized cities such as the Johannesburg Metropolitan City. This work therefore examine the applicability of location based services to determine the movement patterns of Gautrain and Rea Vaya commuters between Sandton and Park station centres, using a case study research design and mixed methods approaches consisting of qualitative, quantitative and spatial data. This research presents novel data analysed into empirical results suggesting that location based services plays a pivotal influence in determining movement of urban public transport commuters in Johannesburg city. The findings also reveal the complexity of spatial and communicative platforms in multiplicity of urban public modes resulting in complex models of movement patterns. These empirical results require further research on the applicability of location based services in determining movement patterns of commuters, with the aim of corroborating the prospects of agglomerating an urban mobility model at a city wide scale.},

Most existing localization algorithm is designed for static sensor networks. 
There are a few localization methods for mobile sensor networks. However, 
Sequential Monte Carlo method (SMC) has been used in localization of mobile 
sensor networks recently. In this paper, we propose a localization algorithm 
based on SMC which can improve the location accuracy. A new method is used 
for sample generation. In that, samples distributes uniformly over the area from 
which samples are drawn instead of random generation of samples in that area. 
This can reduces the number of required samples; besides, this new sample 
generation method enables the algorithm to estimate the maximum location 
error of each node more accurately. Our algorithm also uses the location 
estimation of non-anchor neighbor nodes more efficiently than other 
algorithms. This can improve the localization estimation accuracy highly.},

Application delivery channels such as the Apple AppStore are transforming mobile phones into App Phones, capable of downloading a myriad of applications in an instant. Importantly, today's smartphones are programmable and come with a growing set of cheap powerful embedded sensors, such as an accelerometer, digital compass, gyroscope, GPS, microphone, and camera, which are enabling the emergence of personal, group, and communityscale sensing applications. We believe that sensor-equipped mobile phones will revolutionize many sectors of our economy, including business, healthcare, social networks, environmental monitoring, and transportation. In this article we survey existing mobile phone sensing algorithms, applications, and systems. We discuss the emerging sensing paradigms, and formulate an architectural framework for discussing a number of the open issues and challenges emerging in the new area of mobile phone sensing research.},

in the use of "big" sets of business and administrative government data collected and used for non-statistical purposes, use of such data is not new. Nor is it likely to be a panacea for statistical agencies confronting demands for more, better, and faster data with fewer resources. However, with careful attention to incentives, protection of privacy, and integration of these non-statistical data with existing statistical data, big data can play a large role in improving the accuracy, timeliness, and relevance of economic statistics at a lower cost than expanding existing data collections.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian predictive inference analyzes a dataset to make predictions about new observations. When a model does not match the data, predictive accuracy suffers. We develop population empirical Bayes (POP-EB), a hierarchical framework that explicitly models the empirical population distribution as part of Bayesian analysis. We introduce a new concept, the latent dataset, as a hierarchical variable and set the empirical population as its prior. This leads to a new predictive density that mitigates model mismatch. We efficiently apply this method to complex models by proposing a stochastic variational inference algorithm, called bumping variational inference (BUMP-VI). We demonstrate improved predictive accuracy over classical Bayesian inference in three models: a linear regression model of health data, a Bayesian mixture model of natural images, and a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model of scientific documents.},

ited destinations, Predestination leverages an open-world modeling methodol-
ogy that considers the likelihood of users visiting previously unobserved loca-
tions based on trends in the data and on the background properties of locations. 
This allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between {\textquotedblleft}out of the box{\textquotedblright} with 
no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of observations. 
Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian inference to pro-
duce a probabilistic map of destinations. Our algorithm was trained and tested 
on hold-out data drawn from a database of GPS driving data gathered from 169 
different subjects who drove 7,335 different trips.},

opportunities for collecting digital metadata about the mobility of large populations. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for
the estimation of people density at metropolitan scales, using subscriber presence metadata collected by a mobile operator. Our
approach suits the estimation of static population densities, i.e., of the distribution of dwelling units per urban area contained in
traditional censuses. More importantly, it enables the estimation of dynamic population densities, i.e., the time-varying distributions of
people in a conurbation. By leveraging substantial real-world mobile network metadata and ground-truth information, we demonstrate
that the accuracy of our solution is superior to that granted by state-of-the-art methods in practical heterogeneous urban scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {One pilot project recently implemented in INE (Spain) using big data 
is related to the task of building the frame of visitors crossing the 
borders by road. Due to Schengen Area, there is no direct control of 
people crossing the borders with France and Portugal. 
The register of traffic loops provides the number of vehicles for each 
crossing-road, in both ways (going in and out of Spain), per quarter of 
an hour and according to vehicles length. This information is 
completed by the traffic control cameras installed in the border lines. 
The last is a huge database of number plates of vehicles crossing the 
borders. Combining both sets of big registers (responsibility of the 
Traffic Control Directorate), INE builds the population frame to 
estimate the number of foreign vehicles that enter in Spain monthly, 
broken down by nationality. 
An important methodological challenge currently under research is 
the assessment of the potential of the cameras database to estimate 
international same-day visits. 
These estimations are difficult to obtain from traditional outbound 
tourism sample surveys, as international same-day visitors 
concentrate along the borders, while sample design of these surveys 
(with great potential for mirror-statistics) has more general 
objectives, and there is no subsample big enough to characterize 
these trips. Besides, due to the difficulties and high costs of 
conducting surveys at road borders the quality of the estimations of 
inbound same-day trips could be enhanced with this new information. 
Tracking an anonymized number plate through the camera registers 
database is the first step of the analysis. Those databases contain for 
each vehicle the number plate, the frontier point, the nationality of 
the plate and the moment when it is crossing the border. 
Defining a same-day trip in terms of number of hours (less than 24 
and more than 3) between the moment of going out (coming in) Spain 
and the moment of coming back (going back), and extending the 
tracking to detect vehicles that go in and out through different points, 
we can produce estimates of the ratios of same-day trips in respect of 
the total frame numbers. Thus we can derive subtotals to analyze with 
more precision this specific subset of tourism. The first pilot 
experiences presented in the paper produce the inputs for analysis 
and decision making in order to adjust parameters as border points,},

  abstract  = {Models of population dynamics are frequently used for purposes such as testing
hypotheses about density dependence and predicting species{\textquoteright} responses to future environ-
mental change or conservation actions. Fitting models of population dynamics to field data is
challenging because most data sets are characterized by observation error, which can inflate
estimates of process variation if ignored. Recently, state-space models have been developed to
deal with this problem by directly modeling both the observation error and the ecological
process of interest. Conventional state-space models, however, have several important
limitations: (1) they assume that random effects are Gaussian distributed, which implies that
abundance can be negative and that false positive observation errors are equally likely as false
negative errors; (2) they do not admit spatial variation in population dynamics; and (3) some
of the parameters of the model are not estimable. We demonstrate how each of these problems
can be resolved using a class of hierarchical models proposed by Dail and Madsen (2011) that
attributes observation error to imperfect detection. We expand this class of models to
accommodate classical growth models (e.g., exponential and Ricker-logistic), zero-inflation,
and random effects. We also present methods for forecasting population size under future
environmental conditions. Implementation of these ideas is possible using either frequentist or
Bayesian methods, as demonstrated by accompanying R and JAGS code. Results of a
simulation study suggest that bias is negligible and coverage nominal in most cases for the
proposed model extensions. An analysis of data from the North American Breeding Bird
Survey highlights how these methods can be readily applied to existing data, but it also
suggests that precision will be low when direct information about detection probability (such
as is collected using distance sampling or replicated counts) is lacking.},

  abstract  = {Urban landscapes present a variety of socio-topological environments that are associated to diverse human activities. As
the latter affect the way individuals connect with each other, a bound exists between the urban tissue and the mobile communication
demand. In this paper, we investigate the heterogeneous patterns emerging in the mobile communication activity recorded within
metropolitan regions. To that end, we introduce an original technique to identify classes of mobile traffic signatures that are distinctive
of different urban fabrics. Our proposed technique outperforms previous approaches when confronted to ground-truth information, and
allows characterizing the mobile demand in greater detail than that attained in the literature to date. We apply our technique to
extensive real-world data collected by major mobile operators in ten cities. Results unveil the diversity of baseline communication
activities across countries, but also evidence the existence of a number of mobile traffic signatures that are common to all studied
areas and specific to particular land uses.},

  abstract = {In urban transportation systems, mobility flows in the subway system reflect the spatial and temporal dynamics of working days. To investigate the variability of mobility flows, we analyse the spatial community through a series of snapshots of subway stations over sequential periods. Using Shanghai as a case study, we find that the spatial community snapshots reveal dynamic passenger activities. Adopting a dual-perspective, we apply spatial and temporal models separately to explore where and when individuals travel for entertainment. In the two models, microblog topics and spatial facilities such as food venues and entertainment businesses are used to characterise the spatial popularity of each station and people{\textquoteright}s travelling perceptions. In the studied case, the city centre is characterised by greater social influence, and it is better described by the spatial model. In the temporal model, shorter travel distances motivate individuals to start their trips earlier. Interestingly, as the number of food-related facilities near the starting station increases, until it exceeds 1563, the speed of people{\textquoteright}s journeys slows down. This study provides a method for modelling the effects of social features on mobility flows and for predicting the spatial-temporal mobility flows of newly built subway stations.},

chical and variance component models. For situations where little prior information is available, a {\textquoteright}nonin- 
formative{\textquoteright} type prior is usually chosen. {\textquoteleft}Noninformative{\textquoteright} priors have been discussed by many authors and 
used in many contexts. However, care must be taken using these prior distributions as many are improper 
and thus, can lead to improper posterior distributions. Additionally, in small samples, these priors can be 
{\textquoteright}informative{\textquoteright}. In this paper, we investigate a proper {\textquoteleft}vague{\textquoteright} prior, the uniform shrinkage prior (Strawder- 
man 197 1; Christiansen & Moms 1997). We discuss its properties and show how posterior distributions for 
common hierarchical models using this prior lead to proper posterior distributions. We also illustrate the 
attractive frequentist properties of this prior for a normal hierarchical model including testing and estima- 
tion. To conclude, we generalize this prior to the multivariate situation of a covariance matrix.},

I argue that these developments are unlikely to replace transitional survey data collection, but will supplement surveys and expand the range of research methods. I also argue for the need for the survey research profession to adapt to changing circumstances.},

We then use aggregation of CDR to show the differences between the travel patterns of visitors from different countries and of different lengths of stay. We also show that visitors move differently during event periods and non-event periods, reflecting the importance of real-time data available by CDR. From CDR, we can gain more detailed and complete information about how tourists move compared to traditional surveys, which can be used to aid smarter transportation systems and urban resource planning.},

Introduction 
In this Era, mobile phone has become fashionable to everybody since it is very handy; with a mobile phone in our 
hand we can solve many issues and keep most of information around the world. Mobile phones, assist you to the lot 
of business such as, make schedule of working, and keep in touch with their customers. Initially, when they first 
came out mobile phones were only useful for communicating; now they are of multiple uses by them. With the 
arrival of sophisticated mobile phone it can be used for entertainment purposes also. Mobile Phone can be use as an 
effective the leisure time tool to convert human mind from stress level to free level. 
 Although mobile phones are perceived as devices that directly serve the individuals who own them, they are 
also social artifacts. As a communications technology, they support coordination with others. Additionally, mobile 
telephony communicative practice is influenced by the social contexts in which the phones are used. Communicative 
practice is also influenced by attributes of the owners{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{{\"{Y}}} lifestyle, including their social networks. Furthermore, 
because they are devices that are now present in a variety of contexts, and can be remotely and unpredictably 
activated, mobile phones are subject to social scrutiny and play a role in the social world. They are surrounded by a 
system of actors who wittingly or unwittingly play a role in mobile phone conversation. Mobile phones solve 
problems and provide new channels of communication. We can access the entire world's information no matter 
where we are, just by using a device small enough to fit into one hand. Finally, a user{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{{\"{Y}}}s understanding of how 
mobile telephony works is not only a matter of learning about its multiple technical components (hardware, 
software, and network services), but also of understanding service provider policies and integrating information 
garnered from sales, marketing, and billing communications[1]. Mobile telephony is rapidly becoming a feature of 
our culture, yet we do not understand its effects on communicative practice and behavior, especially with respect to 
the interaction and co-evolution of the technology and human activity. As wireless communications proliferate, 
empirical understanding of practice and social impacts of mobile phone becomes relevant for scholars and 
practitioners alike. So exploring the impact of mobile phones on society is the theme of this article. 
 
Concept of Mobile Phone: A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, and a hand phone) is a 
phone that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link while moving around a wide geographic area. It 
does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access to the public 
telephone network. By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single, private base 
station. In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other services such as text 
messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business 
applications, gaming and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are 
referred to as Smart phones [2]. It can be said that the cultural meaning of the mobile phone has moved beyond that 
of a {\quotedblbase}simple tool{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{{\"{Y}}} or {\quotedblbase}appliance{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{{\"{Y}}}. It has become a commodity. Since virtually everyone owns a mobile phone and 
wears it openly, its value has moved beyond pure utility and into the realm of meaning.},

understanding of urban ecology. The number of cellular phones active in
a geographic area can serve as a proxy for human density in that area.
We are using anonymous records of cellular network activity to study
the spatiotemporal patterns of human density in an urban area. This
paper presents the vision and some early results of this effort. First, we
describe our dataset of six months of activity in the New York metropoli-
tan area. Second, we present a novel technique for estimating network
coverage areas. Third, we describe our approach to analyzing changes
in activity volumes within those areas. Finally, we present preliminary
results regarding changes in human density around Central Park. From
winter to summer, we find that density increases in greenspace areas and
decreases in residential areas.},

gain mainstream popularity, there is increased interest in developing
techniques that can detect anomalous activities. Anomaly detection ca-
pabilities can be used in theft detection, remote elder-care monitoring
systems, and many other applications. In this paper we present an n-
gram based model for modeling a user{\textquoteright}s mobility patterns. Under the
Markovian assumption that a user{\textquoteright}s location at time t depends only on
the last n $-$ 1 locations until t $-$ 1, we can model a user{\textquoteright}s idiosyncratic
location patterns through a collection of n-gram geo-labels, each with
estimated probabilities. We present extensive evaluations of the n-gram
model conducted on real-world data, compare it with the previous ap-
proaches of using T-Patterns and Markovian models, and show that for
anomaly detection the n-gram model outperforms existing work by ap-
proximately 10%. We also show that the model can use a hierarchical
location partitioning system that is able to obscure a user{\textquoteright}s exact loca-
tion, to protect privacy, while still allowing applications to utilize the
obscured location data for modeling anomalies effectively.},

  Abstract                 = {A web survey seems to be an attractive means of collecting survey
data, because it provides simple, cheap and fast access to a large group of people. However, there are pitfalls. Due to methodological problems, the quality of the outcomes of web surveys may be seriously affected. This paper addresses one of these problems, and that is self-selection of respondents.
Self-selection leads to a lack of representativity and thus to biased estimates. The effect of self-selection on the distributional characteristics of estimators is described in detail. It is shown that the bias of estimators in self-selection surveys can be much larger than in surveys based on traditional probability samples. A simulation study also shows what can go wrong in a self-selection
web survey. It is explored whether some correction techniques (adjustment weighting and use of reference surveys) can improve the quality of the outcomes. It turns out that there is no guarantee for success.},

  abstract    = {Official statistics is now considering seriously big data as a significant data source for producing statistics. It holds the potential for providing faster, cheaper, more detailed and completely new types of statistics. However, the use of big data brings also several challenges. One of them is the nonprobabilistic character of most sources of big data, as very often they were not designed to produce statistics. The resulting selectivity bias is therefore a major concern when using big data. This paper presents a statistical approach to big data, searching for a definition meaningful from the statistical point of view and identifying its main statistical characteristics. It then argues that big data sources share many characteristics with Internet opt-in panel surveys and proposes this as a reference to address selectivity and coverage problems in big data. Coverage and the self-selection process are briefly discussed in mobile network data, Twitter, Google Trends and Wikipedia page views data. An overview of methods which can be used to address selectivity and eliminate, or mitigate, bias is then presented, covering both methods applied at individual level, i.e. at the level of the statistical unit, and at domain level, i.e. at the level of the produced statistics. Finally, the applicability of the methods to the several big data sources is briefly discussed and a framework for adjusting selectivity in big data is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of secure multi-party computation (SMC) in a new
model where individual processes contain a tamper-proof security module. Security
modules can be trusted by other processes and can establish secure channels between
each other. However, their availability is restricted by their host, i.e., a corrupted party
can stop the computation of its own security module as well as drop any message sent
by or to its security module. In this model we show that SMC is solvable if and only
if a majority of processes is correct. We prove this by relating SMC to the problem of
Uniform Interactive Consistency among security modules (a variant of the Byzantine
Generals Problem from the area of fault-tolerance). The obtained solutions to SMC
for the first time allow to compute any function securely with a complexity which is
polynomial only in the number of processes (i.e., the complexity does not depend on
the function which is computed). We conclude that adding secure hardware does not
improve the resilience of SMC but can effectively improve the efficiency.},

This is due to the ease with which modern mobile phones can communicate their precise location via the global posi-

A spatial analysis of the aggregate activity generated by such networks can show us how social activity in a city is dis-
tributed, revealing fine-grained spatial patterns evident in the social life of cities. The nature of this new data is discussed
in relation to existing urban data sets. Large-scale data from one such network is analysed across three cities in order
to produce an inter-urban analysis. Comparative measures of polycentricity and fragmentation are used to discuss the
spatial structure of the three cities in question. Finally, the impact of LBS technologies are discussed in the context of
urban analysis.},

  abstract  = {The term computer simulation is related to the usage of a computational model in order to improve the understanding of a system's behavior and/or to evaluate strategies for its operation, in explanatory or predictive schemes. There are cases in which practical or ethical reasons make it impossible to realize direct observations: in these cases, the possibility of realizing 'in-machina' experiments may represent the only way to study, analyze and evaluate models of those realities. Different situations and systems are characterized by the presence of autonomous entities whose local behaviors (actions and interactions) determine the evolution of the overall system; agent-based models are particularly suited to support the definition of models of such systems, but also to support the design and implementation of simulators. Agent-Based models and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been adopted to simulate very different kinds of complex systems, from the simulation of socio-economic systems to the elaboration of scenarios for logistics optimization, from biological systems to urban planning. This paper discusses the specific aspects of this approach to modeling and simulation from the perspective of Informatics, describing the typical elements of an agent-based simulation model and the relevant research.},

  abstract     = {Following the dramatic rise in data collection in recent years, considerable attention has been directed towards adopting innovative methods to compile tourism statistics from nontraditional sources. Many initiatives have emerged globally that adopt big data sources for tourism statistics (e.g. mobile positioning data, booking and ticketing data, web searches, social media, etc). The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential use of call detail records (CDRs) as auxiliary sources for reinforcing and improving the quality of tourism statistics in Saudi Arabia. Using CDR data, the Center for Complex Engineering Systems at KACST and MIT has identified the home locations of anonymous users and analyzed their movement patterns to analyze the destinations of domestic tourists from various cities throughout the country. We use this to determine the flow of tourists between administrative regions and compare the results to statistics collected from traditional facetoface surveys. Additionally, we explore popular destinations for domestic tourists and demonstrate how the sources of tourists can be used to study attractions that are commonly visited by people who live farther away and compare them to destinations that typically receive visitors from nearby cities. Finally, the positions of tourists can be examined in detail to reveal the precise locations of tourist attractions. The possibility of using these passive mobile positioning data for supporting traditional domestic tourism surveys is discussed with the intention of serving the Tourism Statistics System (STS) in Saudi Arabia.

  abstract  = {The study analysed the seasonality of foreign tourists{\textquoteright} space consumption in Estonia using mobile positioning dataset with anonymous
roaming data. The method which uses mobile phone positioning coordinates in space--time movement studies in Estonia is called the social
positioning method. The dataset allowed analysis of the distribution of foreigners{\textquoteright} country of origin in Estonia with the precision of
network cells of mobile operators. Privacy of mobile phone holders was guaranteed according to EU regulation. It was concluded that
seasonality produces very different and sometimes even opposite tourists{\textquoteright} space consumption patterns in Estonia. Coastal areas are popular
for summer tourism and not so popular in winter; continental inland areas were used more for winter tourism. The popular summer tourism
areas along the Baltic Sea beaches are dominated by one nationality: the Finnish in western Estonia, and the Russians in eastern Estonia.
Latvians made up a higher percentage in Saaremaa and P\"{a}rnu during summer and in Otep\"{a}\"{a} and Lake Peipsi in winter. The mobile
positioning data have great potential for tourism studies and monitoring, but is a sensitive issue due to the fear of surveillance.},
