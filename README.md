# Population Estimation

## WP5 Mobile phone data

The aim of this workpackage is to investigate how NSIs may obtain more or less ‘stable’ and continuous access to the mobile phone data. In the current situation, most NSIs face complications to get access to these data due to legal, privacy and contractual issues. On the other hand, the potential of mobile phone data as a data source for official statistics is beyond any debate. This workpackage will describe concrete statistical outputs – relevant for official statistics – based on mobile phone data (and previous studies) and discuss the pro’s and con’s of using aggregated or microdata from mobile phone providers for these actions. The 1st year of the action was used to get access to the data based on this plan. Challenges ahead are: data access, representativity issues, linking to other datasets, linking the outputs to other statistical estimates.

## Statistical outputs

The main statistical output will be the population dynamics in several stages:

* For a sub-municipal partition of the territory and an intra-day time division we will produce a distribution of the population. The grain of these partitions will be decided according to a preliminary analysis of the diverse data sets seeking for maximum comparability.
* The computation of these distributions will also be conducted according to a classification of population in terms of concepts of interest: tourist/non-tourist, commuter/non•commuter,... These concepts will be also chosen according to the preliminary analysis of the data sets.
* These distributions will be completed with mobility matrices expressing how population moves among the territorial grids in the successive time divisions.

The goal of this work package is not these statistical outputs per se but to use them as a vehicle to assess the necessary statistical methodology and technological requirements to obtain the results together with an evaluation of the adequacy of the common data quality framework for Official Statistics.

## Statistical methodologv. IT requirements and data quality

Regarding the methodology the three aspects of greater interest will be:
* the presumably novel statistical methods to perform the classification of units using mobile phone data possibly combined with some other Official Statistics sources and/or outputs (Census, Population Registers, etc.);
*	the inference problem connecting the mobile data set sample with the whole population of interest;
*	the accuracy of the estimations for the population of analysis.

Once the statistical methodology is assessed, in close connection we will identify the technological requirements to implement this analysis. In particular, we will identify:
* needs, if any, for distributed computing; 
* special needs, if any, for data storage; 
* novel needs, if any, for software.

The quality of the statistical outputs will also be evaluated with a double purpose:

* to assess the quality of the novelties in the statistical production, both from the point of view of the process and of the product; 
* to assess the adequacy of the common quality framework for this new source of data.

## Phase 5

The final phase of the work package (Future perspectives) will be accounted crosssectionally, i.e. all findings in each task will be correspondingly assessed in terms of their immediate and future applicability under standard production conditions within the ESS.

As part of the future perspectives, we will analyse those conditions in each task related to international comparability, data sharing among NSls and sustainability of sources for production in the long term.

The reporting will be undertaken with two simultaneous generic goals: (i) to clearly report about each detailed step necessary to produce the statistical outputs and (ii) to produce clear guidelines for all members within the ESS in the verge of using mobile phone data for their production.
